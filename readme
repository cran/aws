AWS is a library containing functions to perform the Propagation-Separation approach as introduced in

    Polzehl, J. and Spokoiny, V. (2006). Local Likelihood Modeling by Adaptive Weights Smoothing.
    Probability Theory and Related Fields, Vol.135, 335--362 .

For local polynomial smoothing see  

    Polzehl, J. and Spokoiny, V. (2007). Structural Adaptive Smoothing by Propagation-Separation-Methods,
    In: Handbook of Data Visualization (Edts. Chen, C., Haerdle, W. and Unwin, A), Springer Handbooks of Computational Statistics.

The package can also be used ( parameters aws=FALSE, memory=TRUE) to perform
the stagewise aggregation approach, see 

    Belomestny, D. and Spokoiny, V. (2007). Spatial aggregation of local likelihood estimates with applications to classification,  Ann. Statist.  25 ,  2287--2311. 

As an alternative procedure the package now includes an implementation of
the Intersection of Confidence Intervals (ICI) methods from

     Katkovnik, V.  Egiazarian, K. and  Astola, J. (2006), Local Approximation Techniques in Signal And Image Processing},
     SPIE Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engin., PM157, Chapter 6.


The library has been reimplementated using S4-classes. Functionality has been rearranged. 
Functions now handle 1D/2D/3D data (if implemented for the specified model).
Functions for density estimation and tail-index estimation have been removed.
Additional functionality includes local constant Gaussian models for
irregular design (function aws.irreg) and Gaussian models with global mean-variance model (aws.gaussian).

AWS 1.7-0 or higher supports OpenMP. If you wish to enable multiprocessing via OpenMP, install AWS with configure argument
- from shell
  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--enable-openmp' aws_<version>.tar.gz.

- from R session
  install.packages("aws", configure.args="--enable-openmp")

As an OpenMP standard, the environment variable 'OMP_NUM_THREADS' is used to determine the number of threads.
If OMP_NUM_THREADS is not set or less or equal 0 the OpenMP behavior is implementation dependend and therefore undefinded.
It is highly recommended to set OMP_NUM_THREADS to a value between (including) 2 and # of cores before starting a R session.

Please notice that an OpenMP compiled version of AWS with OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 is usually slower than a pure AWS installation.
