AWS is a library containing functions to perform the Propagation-Separation approach as introduced in

    Polzehl, J. and Spokoiny, V. (2006). Local Likelihood Modeling by Adaptive Weights Smoothing.
    Probability Theory and Related Fields, Vol.135, 335--362 .

For local polynomial smoothing see  

    Polzehl, J. and Spokoiny, V. (2007). Structural Adaptive Smoothing by Propagation-Separation-Methods,
    In: Handbook of Data Visualization (Edts. Chen, C., Haerdle, W. and Unwin, A), Springer Handbooks of Computational Statistics.

The package can also be used ( parameters aws=FALSE, memory=TRUE) to perform
the stagewise aggregation approach, see 

    Belomestny, D. and Spokoiny, V. (2007). Spatial aggregation of local likelihood estimates with applications to classification,  Ann. Statist.  25 ,  2287--2311. 


The library has been reimplementated using S4-classes. Functionality has been rearranged. 
Functions now handle 1D/2D/3D data (if implemented for the specified model).
Functions for density estimation and tail-index estimation have been removed.
Additional functionality includes local constant Gaussian models for
irregular design (function aws.irreg) and Gaussian models with global mean-variance model (aws.gaussian).
